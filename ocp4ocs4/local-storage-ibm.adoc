== Installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage Operator using the Operator Hub

Start with creating the `openshift-storage` namespace.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc create namespace openshift-storage
----

You must add the monitoring label to this namespace. This is required to get prometheus metrics and alerts for the OCP storage dashboards. To label the `openshift-storage` namespace use the following command:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc label namespace openshift-storage "openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true"
----

[NOTE]
====
If deploying OCS pre-release version, *skip* the steps above to create openshift-storage namespace. Instead use https://raw.githubusercontent.com/red-hat-storage/ocs-training/ocs-ibm/ocp4ocs4/deploy-with-olm.yaml[deploy-with-olm.yaml] and execute `oc create -f deploy-with-olm.yaml`.

.Example output:
----
namespace/openshift-storage created
operatorgroup.operators.coreos.com/openshift-storage-operatorgroup created
catalogsource.operators.coreos.com/ocs-catalogsource created
catalogsource.operators.coreos.com/lib-bucket-catalogsource created
----
====

Now switch over to your *Openshift Web Console*. You can get your URL by issuing command below to get the OCP 4 `console` route.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get -n openshift-console route console
----

Once you are logged in, navigate to the *OperatorHub* menu.

.OCP OperatorHub
image::OCS-OCP-OperatorHub.png[OCP OperatorHub]

Now type `openshift container storage` in the *Filter by _keyword..._* box.

.OCP OperatorHub filter on OpenShift Container Storage Operator
image::OCS4-OCP-OperatorHub-Filter.png[OCP OperatorHub Filter]

Select `OpenShift Container Storage Operator` and then select *Install*.

On the next screen make sure the settings are as shown in this figure. Also, make sure to change to `A specific namespace on the cluster` and chose namespace `openshift-storage`.

.OCP Subscribe to OpenShift Container Storage
image::OCS4-OCP-OperatorHub-Subscribe.png[OCP OperatorHub Subscribe]

NOTE: Do not change any configuration other than the namespace as shown above.

Click `Subscribe`.

Now you can go back to your terminal window to check the progress of the installation.

[source,role="execute"]
----
watch oc -n openshift-storage get csv
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                            DISPLAY                       VERSION        REPLACES   PHASE
lib-bucket-provisioner.v1.0.0   lib-bucket-provisioner        1.0.0                     Succeeded
ocs-operator.v4.3.0             OpenShift Container Storage   4.3.0                     Succeeded
----
.Please wait until both operators `PHASE` changes to `Succeeded`

You can exit by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+C]

You will now also see operator pods have been started in the `openshift-storage` namespace:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n openshift-storage get pods
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
lib-bucket-provisioner-55f74d96f6-mkrz2   1/1     Running   0          3m48s
noobaa-operator-68c8fbdff5-kgxxt          1/1     Running   0          3m41s
ocs-operator-78d98758db-dwc8h             1/1     Running   0          3m41s
rook-ceph-operator-55cb44fcfc-wxppc       1/1     Running   0          3m41s
----

Navigate to the `Operators` menu on the left and select `Installed Operators`. Make sure the selected project at the top of the UI pane is set to `openshift-storage`. What you see should be similar to the following example:

image::OCP4-installed-operators.png[Openshift showing the installed operators in namespace openshift-storage]

Now that the operator pods are running, you can create a Storage Cluster.

== Installing OpenShift Container Storage on Local Storage Devices

Use this procedure to install OpenShift Container Storage (OCS) on bare metal, Amazon EC2, and VMware infrastructures where OpenShift Container Platform 4 (OCP) is already installed.

[NOTE]
====
The following sections use YAML files and CLI to create resources used to deploy OCS 4 on local storage devices. In future releases of OCP 4 and OCS 4 these operations will have the option of being done using the *Openshift Web Console* UI making using local storage easier and less error prone.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Installing OpenShift Container Storage on bare metal, Amazon EC2, and VMware using local storage operator is a Technology Preview feature. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
====

=== Prerequisites

* You must have at least 3 OCP worker nodes in the cluster with locally attached storage devices on each of them.
* Each worker node must have a minimum of 12 CPUs and 64 GB Memory.
* Each of the 3 worker nodes must have at least one available raw block device available to be used by OCS (e.g., 100 GB size).
* You must have a minimum of three labeled worker nodes.

** Each OCP worker node must have an specific label to deploy OCS *Pods*. To label the nodes use the following command:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc label node <NodeName> cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage=''
----

NOTE: Make sure to add this label to all OCP workers that have local storage devices to be used by OCS.

* No other storage providers managing locally mounted storage on the storage nodes should be present that will conflict with the Local Storage Operator (LSO).

=== Installing the Local Storage Operator

Start with creating the `local-storage` namespace.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc new-project local-storage
----

Now switch over to your *Openshift Web Console* and select *OperatorHub*. Type `local storage` in the *Filter by _keyword..._* box.

image::OCP4-LSO-filter.png[OperatorHub LSO Operator filter]

Select `Local Storage Operator` and then select *Install*.

On the next screen make sure the settings are as shown in this figure. Also, make sure to change to `A specific namespace on the cluster` and chose namespace `local-storage`.

.OCP Subscribe to Local Storage Operator
image::OCS4-OCP-OperatorHub-LSO-Subscribe.png[OCP OperatorHub Subscribe]

NOTE: Do not change any configuration other than the namespace as shown above.

Click `Subscribe`.

Now you can go back to your terminal window to check the progress of the installation.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n local-storage get pods
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
local-storage-operator-765dc5b87-vfh69   1/1     Running   0          23s
----

The Local Storage Operator (LSO) has been successfully installed. Now move on to creating local persistent volumes (PVs) on the storage nodes using LocalVolume Custom Resource (CR) files.

=== Finding Available Storage Devices

Using LSO to create *PVs* can be done for bare metal, Amazon EC2, or VMware storage devices. What you must know is the exact device name on each of the 3 or more OCP worker nodes you labeled with OCS label `cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage=''`. The method to do this is to logon to each node and verify the device names as well, the size of each device, and that the device is available.

First verify the names of the worker nodes with the OCS label:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes -l cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage=
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                                         STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
ip-10-0-135-71.us-east-2.compute.internal    Ready    worker   6h45m   v1.16.2
ip-10-0-145-125.us-east-2.compute.internal   Ready    worker   6h45m   v1.16.2
ip-10-0-160-91.us-east-2.compute.internal    Ready    worker   6h45m   v1.16.2
----

Now that you have the worker nodes that have the OCS label you can logon to each node (or a single node if they are all the same) and verify the device name for each available raw block device.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc debug node/<NodeName>
----

.Example output:
----
oc debug node/ip-10-0-135-71.us-east-2.compute.internal
Starting pod/ip-10-0-135-71us-east-2computeinternal-debug ...
To use host binaries, run `chroot /host`
Pod IP: 10.0.135.71
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
sh-4.2# chroot /host
sh-4.4# lsblk
NAME                         MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda                         202:0    0   120G  0 disk
|-xvda1                      202:1    0   384M  0 part /boot
|-xvda2                      202:2    0   127M  0 part /boot/efi
|-xvda3                      202:3    0     1M  0 part
`-xvda4                      202:4    0 119.5G  0 part
  `-coreos-luks-root-nocrypt 253:0    0 119.5G  0 dm   /sysroot
nvme0n1                      259:0    0   1.7T  0 disk
nvme1n1                      259:1    0   1.7T  0 disk
----

In this case the EC2 instance type is i3.4xlarge so we know all 3 worker nodes are the same. As shown above the results of 'lsblk' shows the last 2 devices, `nvme0n1` and `nvme1n1` are available with a size of 1.7 TB each. Next step is to create new *PVs* using these devices.

=== Using the LSO LocalVolume Custom Resource to Create PVs

The next step is to create the LSO LocalVolume CR which in turn will create *PVs* and a new *StorageClass* for creating Ceph storage.

[source,yaml]
.LocalVolume CR local-storage-block.yaml using OCS label as Node Selector:
----
apiVersion: local.storage.openshift.io/v1
kind: LocalVolume
metadata:
  name: local-block
  namespace: local-storage
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    nodeSelectorTerms:
    - matchExpressions:
        - key: cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage
          operator: In
          values:
          - ""
  storageClassDevices:
    - storageClassName: localblock
      volumeMode: Block
      devicePaths:
        - /dev/nvme0n1             # <-- modify this line
        - /dev/nvme1n1             # <-- modify this line
----

Create this LocalVolume CR using the following command:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc create -f local-storage-block.yaml
----
.Example output:
----
localvolume.local.storage.openshift.io/local-block created
----

Now that the CR is created let's see the results.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n local-storage get pods
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
local-block-local-diskmaker-kkp7j        1/1     Running   0          5m1s

local-storage-operator-765dc5b87-vfh69   1/1     Running   0          53m
----

There should now be a new *PV* for each of the local storage devices on the 3 worker nodes. Remember when we checked above there were 2 available storage devices per worker node and the size for each was 1.7 TB.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pv
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS      CLAIM   STORAGECLASS   REASON   AGE
local-pv-40bd1474   1769Gi     RWO            Delete           Available           localblock              5m53s
local-pv-53994ff9   1769Gi     RWO            Delete           Available           localblock              5m53s

local-pv-c56e9c     1769Gi     RWO            Delete           Available           localblock              5m53s
local-pv-c63a7061   1769Gi     RWO            Delete           Available           localblock              5m53s
local-pv-d2a3dcde   1769Gi     RWO            Delete           Available           localblock              5m52s
----

And finally we should have an additional *StorageClass* as a result of creating this LocalVolume CR. This *StorageClass* will be used when creating *PVCs* in the next step of creating a *StorageCluster*.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get sc
----
.Example output:
----
NAME            PROVISIONER                    AGE
gp2 (default)   kubernetes.io/aws-ebs          7h14m
localblock      kubernetes.io/no-provisioner   7m46s
----

The next sections will detail how to create and validate the OCS *StorageCluster* using Amazon EC2, VMware, and bare metal local storage devices.

=== Creating the OCS Storage Cluster on AWS

For Amazon EC2 instance that have local storage devices (e.g., i3.4xlarge) we need to create a *StorageCluster* Custom Resource (CR) that will use the `localblock` *StorageClass* and 3 of the 6 *PVs* created in the previous section.

[source,yaml]
.StorageCluster CR ocs-cluster-service.yaml using `gp2` and `localblock` storageclasses:
----
apiVersion: ocs.openshift.io/v1
kind: StorageCluster
metadata:
  name: ocs-storagecluster
  namespace: openshift-storage
spec:
  manageNodes: false
  monPVCTemplate:
    spec:
      accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 10Gi
      storageClassName: gp2
      volumeMode: Filesystem
  storageDeviceSets:
  - count: 1
    dataPVCTemplate:
      spec:
        accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1
        storageClassName: localblock
        volumeMode: Block
    name: ocs-deviceset
    placement: {}
    portable: false
    replica: 3
    resources: {}
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `storage` size for *storageDeviceSets* must be less than or equal to the size of the raw block devices. Setting the value to `1` will guarantee that this requirement is met.
====

Create this StorageCluster CR using the following command:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/red-hat-storage/ocs-training/master/ocp4ocs4/yamls/cluster-service-AWS.yaml
----
.Example output:
----
storagecluster.ocs.openshift.io/ocs-storagecluster created
----

==== Validating the successful OCS Storage Cluster creation on AWS

Once the *StorageCluster* is created OCS pods will start showing up in the `openshift-storage` namespace. For the deployment to completely finish could take up to 10 minutes so be patient. Below you will find examples of a successful deployment of the OCS *Pods* and *PVCs*.

=== Creating the OCS Storage Cluster on VMware

The process for using local storage devices for OCP on VMware environments is very similar but has some differences. The first is the types of local storage that is supported for VMware. The 3 types are the following:

* VMDK
* Raw Device Mapping (RDM)
* VMDirectPath

In order to use local storage devices on VMware you must have a minimum of 3 worker nodes with the `same` storage type attached to each node.

For AWS the OCS Monitor storage was created using the gp2 *StorageClass* so there was no need to create and additional *StorageClass* for `Filesystem` volume mode. For VMware we do want to create another *StorageClass* as well as update the LocalVolume CR shown in the AWS section to use the correct device names.

In order to create the `Filesystem` LocalVolume CR you need to first create and attach a 10 GB VMDK to each of the OCP worker nodes with the OCS label and the storage devices that will be used for your OCS *StorageCluster*.

Once this has been done you can use a similar method as done for AWS by logging on to the OCP worker nodes with the OCS label (see <<Prerequisites>>) and issuing a `lsblk`. By inspecting the results of this command you will know which devices are available and what the size of each device is (e.g., /dev/sdb and size is 10 GB and /dev/sdc is 100 GB). See <<Finding Available Storage Devices>> for more details.

This is an example for the LocalVolume CR for case where the 10 GB VMDK created and attached to each worker and has the device name of /dev/sdb.

----

[NOTE]
====
If your OCP deployment has the `thin` *StorageClass* available for creating and attaching VMDKs to OCP nodes this can be used in place of `localfile`. You do not need then to create the `localfile` *StorageClass* using the LocalVolume CR with Filesystem volume mode shown above.

=== Creating the OCS Storage Cluster on Bare Metal

The process for using local storage devices for OCP on bare methal environments is very similar to both AWS and VMware environments with some differences.

In order to use local storage devices on bare metal servers you must have a minimum of 3 worker nodes. Each of the machines must have at least one raw block device and the `same` storage type attached to each node (.e.g., 2TB NVMe Hard Drive).

To identify the storage devices on each node use the same method as the one used for AWS and VMWare environments by logging on to each OCS worker node and issuing a lsblk command. By inspecting the results of this command you will know which devices are available and their size. See <<Finding Available Storage Devices>> for more details.

For Monitor storage, a Filesystem *StorageClass* does not need to be created as it was for VMware. In the StorageCluster CR use *monDataDirHostPath* and set its value to /var/lib/rook for Monitor storage.

[NOTE]
====
You can also configure a raw block device with a Filesystem mode for Monitor Storage as demonstrated in the VMWare section. The downside of this method is that the Monitors have a minimum requirement of only 10 GB while local storage devices will always be larger. This will result in wasting the local storage space.
====

First step is to create the LocalVolume CR for Block *PVs*.

== Using the Rook-Ceph toolbox to Validate Ceph backing storage

Starting with OpenShift Container Storage 4.3 the deployment of a *toolbox* can be created by modifying the *CustomResource* `OCSInitialization`.

You can either patch the `OCSInitialization ocsinit` using the following command line:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc patch OCSInitialization ocsinit -n openshift-storage --type json --patch  '[{ "op": "replace", "path": "/spec/enableCephTools", "value": true }]'
----

Or you can edit the `OCSInitialization ocsinit` to toggle the `enableCephTools` parameter to *true* using the following command line:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc edit OCSInitialization ocsinit
----

The `spec` item must be set to the following value:

[source,role="execute"]
----
spec:
  enableCephTools: true
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Toggling the value from `true` to `false` will terminate any running *toolbox* pod immediately.
====

After the `rook-ceph-tools` *Pod* is `Running` you can access the toolbox like this:

[source,role="execute"]
----
TOOLS_POD=$(oc get pods -n openshift-storage -l app=rook-ceph-tools -o name)
oc rsh -n openshift-storage $TOOLS_POD
----

Once inside the toolbox, try out the following Ceph commands to see the status of Ceph, the total number of OSDs (example below shows six after expanding storage), and the total amount of storage available in the cluster.
